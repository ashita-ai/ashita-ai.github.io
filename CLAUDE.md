# Ashita.ai Blog Guidelines

## Voice & Style

- Short declarative sentences. No fluff.
- Open with facts or concrete incidents, not assertions
- Every post needs a clear thesis by paragraph 3
- Dry humor sparingly - never forced
- Use "I" naturally but specifically
- End with understated conclusions, not slogans
- Include a "What I am still figuring out" section for intellectual honesty

## Structure

- Front matter: `layout: post`, `title`, `date`
- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug-with-dashes.md`
- Section headers: `## Short and punchy`
- Tables for organizing comparisons
- Inline hyperlinks woven naturally, not dumped as evidence

## Formatting Rules

- No em dashes - use parentheses instead
- No bold emphasis mid-paragraph (except for list item labels)
- No emojis ever
- Contractions optional but keep consistent within post

## Content Standards

- Do not hallucinate. Every claim must be verifiable.
- Double-check every citation before publishing
- Do not invent personal anecdotes or experiences
- Do not fabricate quotes or statistics
- If citing research, fetch and verify the source first
- If a number seems too convenient, verify it

## What Makes Posts Interesting

- A concrete incident or story in the opening
- A sticky number people will remember (e.g., "17x vs 4x", "68%", "$47,000")
- A contrarian or surprising angle
- Real consequences (costs, user abandonment, trust erosion)
- Pattern recognition from experience, not just research summaries

## What to Avoid

- Generic advice anyone could write
- Literature reviews disguised as blog posts
- Plugging specific vendors/products as recommendations
- Recycling analogies from previous posts
- Slogany endings ("Build the recovery path before you need it")
- Meta phrases like "Here's the thing" or "That's the core issue"
- Exaggeration for effect

## Brand Positioning

This blog supports a path toward fractional CTO/CDO positioning:

| Content Type | Current | Target |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Technical depth | High | 30% |
| Strategic/leadership | Low | 50% |
| Industry opinions | Low | 20% |

Posts should demonstrate strategic thinking and decision-making frameworks, not just technical implementation. Frame expertise as "how to decide" not "how to do."

## Process

1. Research thoroughly before drafting
2. Verify all citations as you go, not after
3. Draft in user's voice
4. Review for hallucinations and unverified claims
5. Check that the thesis is clear and the post builds toward it
6. Ensure memorable elements exist (incident, stat, consequence)
