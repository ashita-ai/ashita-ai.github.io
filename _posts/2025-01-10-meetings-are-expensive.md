title: "Meetings Are Expensive"

A one-hour meeting with eight people is not a one-hour meeting. It is eight hours of labor. If those people average $150/hour fully loaded, that meeting costs $1,200.

This math rarely makes its way into the calendar invite.

## The math is brutal

The numbers vary by study, but the direction is consistent. [Bloomberg estimates](https://www.flowtrace.co/collaboration-blog/50-meeting-statistics) unnecessary meetings waste $25,000 per employee annually. Estimates of total US cost range from [$37 billion](https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-fix-the-most-soul-crushing-meetings) to nearly [$400 billion](https://doodle.com/en/resources/research-and-reports-/the-state-of-meetings-2019/) per year. The range is wide because "unproductive" is subjective. The waste is not.

What is not subjective: [71% of senior managers](https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-fix-the-most-soul-crushing-meetings) say meetings are unproductive. [64% of recurring meetings](https://www.flowtrace.co/collaboration-blog/meeting-agenda-effectiveness-why-validation-matters) have no agenda at all.

## Three rules for cost-effective meetings

### 1. Agenda out 24 hours before

For meetings with more than four people, send the agenda 24 hours ahead. [Research on meeting effectiveness](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6743516/) supports this practice. If you have not done this, you are not ready to be in the meeting.

### 2. Define success before you start

What outcome or decision needs to happen? What does the world look like after this meeting that is different from before?

If you cannot answer this, cancel the meeting. Send an email.

Once you know what success looks like, the attendee list follows. Who can make this decision? Who has information required to make it? Those people attend. Everyone else does not.

[Stanford research](https://hbr.org/2018/06/the-most-productive-meetings-have-fewer-than-8-people) found that productive meetings contain five to eight people. [Bezos' two-pizza rule](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/amazon-two-pizza-team/) says the same thing differently: if two pizzas cannot feed the group, it is too large.

The math is simple: five people means ten possible conversations, eight people means twenty-eight. Coordination costs grow faster than headcount.

### 3. Start on time. End on time. Or early.

No waiting for stragglers. If the meeting hits its goal early, end it. A 25-minute meeting that achieves its goal beats a 60-minute meeting that wanders.

## Enforcement matters

These rules only work if you actually enforce them. The first time someone shows up unprepared and the meeting proceeds anyway, the norm is dead. The first time you run over because "we are almost done," people stop trusting the end time.

It helps to make the cost visible. That status update with twelve people? $1,800. The weekly sync that could be a Slack message? $60,000/year.

## What I still get wrong

I am not claiming to have this solved.

**Recurring meetings that outlive their usefulness.** I audit quarterly and still miss some.

**The meeting that should have been a document.** Writing is harder, so the meeting happens

**The "quick sync" that expands.** Two people align. A third joins for context. Then a fourth.

The root cause is the same: scheduling a meeting is easier than thinking carefully about whether one is needed.

Meetings are not inherently bad. Some problems require synchronous discussion. Some decisions need real-time debate. But the default should be no meeting, with the burden of proof on whoever wants to schedule one.

The calendar is not free.
