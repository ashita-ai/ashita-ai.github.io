  <p class="about-tagline">The difference isn't the tech. It's the decisions made in the first year that compound for the next five.</p>

  <p>I'm Evan Volgas. I've spent 20+ years building data and distributed systems across Netflix, Mailchimp, Capital One, and a handful of startups. I'm currently working on AI-enabled data engineering and wealth tech.</p>

  <p>I have seen startups and data teams fail. I have seen them succeed. The pattern is consistent: <a href="{{ '/blog/the-ai-pilot-graveyard/' | relative_url }}">pilots that never reach production</a>, <a href="{{ '/blog/the-data-platform-decisions-that-haunt-you/' | relative_url }}">architecture decisions that haunt you</a>, <a href="{{ '/blog/healthy-metrics-broken-agent/' | relative_url }}">healthy metrics on broken systems</a>. The technology usually works. The problem is everything else.</p>

  <p>I <a href="{{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}">write about</a> what I've learned. I also build <a href="{{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}">tools</a> that didn't survive corporate roadmaps but deserved to exist anyway.</p>

  <p>If you want to talk about data platforms, AI systems, or the decisions that matter before the code does, <a href="{{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}">get in touch</a>.</p>
