  <p class="about-tagline">Hi, my name is Evan Volgas & I build data platforms that survive contact with production.</p>

  <p>I've spent 20+ years building data and distributed systems across Netflix, Mailchimp, Capital One, and a handful of startups. I'm currently working on AI-enabled data engineering and wealth tech.</p>

  <p>I have seen startups and data teams fail. I have seen them succeed. The difference isn't the tech. It's the decisions made in the first year that compound for the next five.</p>

  <p>I've built pipelines that processed millions of events per second. I've also built pipelines that processed twelve events per day and mattered more. Scale is not the point. The point is knowing which problems are worth solving and which architectures will still make sense when requirements change.</p>

  <p>This site is where I put the <a href="{{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}">misfit data tools</a> that do not fit anywhere else. Tools I built because I needed them. Ideas that did not survive the roadmap but deserved to exist anyway.</p>

  <p>If you want to talk about data platforms, AI systems, or why your pipeline keeps breaking at 3am, <a href="{{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}">get in touch</a>.</p>
