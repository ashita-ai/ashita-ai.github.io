Memory is strange.

It's not a filing cabinet. It's not a database. It doesn't work by exact match. You remember things by association, by feel, by context you can't quite articulate. You forget what you thought you'd remember and remember what you thought you'd forgotten.

Engram takes this seriously.

## What it does

Engram is a memory layer for applications that need to remember things the way humans do—not perfectly, but usefully. It provides:

- **Associative retrieval** that finds related memories even when the query doesn't match exactly
- **Graceful forgetting** that lets old, unused memories fade rather than accumulate forever
- **Contextual recall** that considers when and how something was stored, not just what
- **Semantic connections** between memories that weren't explicitly linked

## The philosophy

Most storage systems optimize for precision. Engram optimizes for usefulness. Sometimes the most helpful thing isn't an exact match—it's something adjacent, something that reminds you of what you were actually looking for.

This makes it suited for AI systems, conversational interfaces, and anywhere that "close enough" is better than "not found."

## Status

Engram is available for early adopters. The core memory engine works; we're refining the forgetting curves and association algorithms based on real-world usage.
